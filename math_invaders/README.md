# Math Invaders - CS196 Final Project

**Math Invaders** is an educational arcade-style game developed in Python using the Pygame library as a final project for CS196. The game combines classic space invader mechanics with math problem-solving to create an engaging learning experience.

## 🎮 Description

In **Math Invaders**, players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down descending invaders by solving math problems. Each invader carries a different math equation, and players must fire the correct answer to eliminate them. The game gradually increases in difficulty, promoting both quick thinking and arithmetic skills.

## 🧠 Features

- Developed using Python and Pygame
- Dynamic generation of math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.)
- Interactive shooting mechanics with answer selection
- Score tracking and level progression
- Game over and restart functionality
